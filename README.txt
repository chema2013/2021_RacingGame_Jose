Path Creator
        This package is Free and contains some scripts and the path editor in which you can assign which object is going to follow that path.
        It also gives other options like adjusting the speed of the object or making a path in a 3D space.
        We used it to simulate the movement of the oponent, of the other snail

Too Many Items: Trophies
